Architectural notes for traffic simulator

Car class
    source (point along an edge)
    destination
    state (crashed/operational/parked/others?)
    current speed limit
    speed

Use driver class?
how to be efficient (time/memory)

Street Light Set class
    method for turn signal timing (both turn signals at once, or at the beginning/end)
    turn lanes
    may or may not have turn lights
    may or may not have walk signals
    car counter (how many cars passed through in green, yellow, red)

pedestrian class
    include social tendencies for multiple people to be in groups?
    walking speed
    distraction cost/delay

Intersection class
    can contain street light set
    Can contain walk signals
    knows roads that intersect there
    Can contain stop signs (s.t. stop signs xor street light set == true)

How to represent road intersections?
    more complex than a simple graph
        should (usually) maintain the same street name after an intersection
        Never the endpoints for 2 roads (not an intersection). >= 1 must pass through.

Train class (could model very simply)
    length/speed = time that it stops traffic

include highways with on/off ramps?

road objects
    speed limit
    construction/accidents

Parameters for adjustment:
    distribution of source/destination locations along edges
    distribution of driver aggresiveness
    likelihood of car accidents
    speeds reported in kmph or mph
    likelihood of > 2 streets intersecting in the same place
